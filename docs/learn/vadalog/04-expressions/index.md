# Expressions

An **expression** is inductively defined as follows:

1. a constant is an expression
2. a variable is an expression
3. a proper combination of expressions (by means of operators) is an expression

Expressions appear in specific parts of a Vadalog program, namely in **operators**, **conditions** and **assignments**.

## Topics in this Section

This section covers all aspects of working with expressions in Vadalog:

- **[Operators](/learn/vadalog/expressions/operators)** - Comparison, arithmetic, boolean, logical, and string operators
- **[Negation](/learn/vadalog/expressions/negation)** - Negating truth values and safe usage patterns
- **[Conditions & Assignments](/learn/vadalog/expressions/conditions-assignments)** - Constraining values and generating new ones
- **[Recursion](/learn/vadalog/expressions/recursion)** - Recursive rules and graph traversal
- **[Aggregations](/learn/vadalog/expressions/aggregations)** - Monotonic aggregations for computing sums, counts, min/max
- **[Collections](/learn/vadalog/expressions/collections)** - Working with arrays, lists, and sets
- **[Specialized Functions](/learn/vadalog/expressions/specialized-functions)** - Math, hash, date/time, type casting, and interval functions
- **[AI Functions](/learn/vadalog/expressions/ai-functions)** - Embeddings and LLM integration

Each topic includes comprehensive examples showing practical usage in Vadalog programs.
