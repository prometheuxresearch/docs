# Negation

Negation is a prefix modifier that negates the truth value for an atom. In logic
terms, we say that a negated formula holds whenever it is false, for example
`not employee(X)` holds if `X` is not an employee. Negation has higher
precedence than conjunction, so the single atoms are negated and not the entire
body (or parts thereof).

The following assumptions are made:

1. Every variable that occurs in the head must have a binding in a non-negated
   atom.
2. Every binding of a variable that occurs only in a negation is not exported
   outside of the negation.

It is clear that assumption 2 implies assumption 1: as the bindings captured
within the negation cannot be used outside the negation itself, they cannot be
used to generate new facts in the head.

However 2 is more specific, since it even forbids joins in the body based on
negatively bound variables.

Whereas assumption 1 is enforced in the Engine and its violation causes a
runtime error, condition 2 is not enforced and negatively bound joins can be
used (albeit discouraged), being aware of the theoretical and practical
implications.

```prolog showLineNumbers {10}
employee("Mark").
employee("Ruth").
director("Jane").
hired("Ruth").
contractor("Mark").
project(1,"Mark").
project(2,"Ruth").
project(3,"Jane").

safeProjects(X,P) :- project(X,P), not contractor(P).

@output("safeProjects").
```

The expected result is:

```
safeProjects(2, "Ruth").
safeProjects(3, "Jane").
```

Here we select the safe projects, which are those run by a person who is not a
contractor. Since a person can have various company attributes (`employee`,
`hired`, etc.), even at the same time, here we simply check that he/she is not a
contractor.

Consider this next example:

```prolog showLineNumbers {10,11}
s(1, 2).
s(2, 3).
s(3, 5).
s(4, 6).
b(6, 2).
b(4, 2).
b(2, 2).
c(2).

f(X, Y) :- s(X, Y), not b(Y, Z).
f(Y, X) :- f(X, Y), not b(X, Z).

@output("f").
```

The expected result is:

```
f(5, 3).
f(2, 3).
f(3, 5).
```

Here we combine recursion and negation and recursively generate f, by negating
b.
