---

## üì¶ Installation

Install directly from the Snowflake Marketplace or deploy using the provided setup scripts.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### ‚úÖ **FULLY AUTOMATED SETUP**

The platform uses database-driven configuration management. All settings are stored automatically and applied during startup.

### Launch from Snowsight UI (Recommended)

1. **Navigate to Snowsight**: Go to your Snowflake web interface
2. **Find the App**: Navigate to Data > Apps > Prometheux
3. **Launch**: Click the "Launch App" button
4. **Initialize**: The app will auto-configure and provide a launch URL

**That's it!** The platform will automatically:
- Create required databases and schemas
- Set up default configuration
- Start with optimal settings
- Provide platform access URL

### üéõÔ∏è **Configuration Management**

All configuration is stored in the database and applied automatically:

```sql
-- Set up database and schema context
USE DATABASE prometheux;
USE SCHEMA v1;

-- View current configuration
CALL get_app_configuration();
```

### üè≠ **Warehouse Configuration**

Prometheux automatically creates a dedicated warehouse called `PROMETHEUX_WAREHOUSE` to perform read/write operations on your Snowflake databases you will give access to. This warehouse is configured with:

- **Size**: SMALL (optimal for most workloads)
- **Auto-suspend**: 180 seconds (3 minutes)
- **Auto-resume**: Enabled
- **Cost**: Approximately $0.0023/hour when active

> **üí∞ Cost Optimization**: Prometheux minimizes warehouse usage costs by storing application data in an internal PostgreSQL database within the compute pool, only using the Snowflake warehouse for operations on your Snowflake databases.

#### Customizing Warehouse Settings

```sql
-- Or use your existing warehouse alongside the app warehouse
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE YOUR_EXISTING_WH TO APPLICATION prometheux;
```

#### Using Custom Warehouses in Database Operations

When performing operations on your Snowflake databases, you can specify a custom warehouse using the `warehouse` parameter:

```sql
-- Example: Query data using a specific warehouse
-- (This option will be available when configuring database connections)
-- warehouse='YOUR_CUSTOM_WAREHOUSE'
```

> **üí° Tip**: The default `PROMETHEUX_WAREHOUSE` is suitable for most use cases. Only customize if you need different performance characteristics or want to consolidate billing with existing warehouses.

### üîß **Essential Procedures**

**Core Platform Management:**
- `init()` - Initialize/restart platform with stored configuration
  ```sql
  CALL init();
  ```

- `stop_platform()` - Stop platform and create snapshot
  ```sql
  CALL stop_platform();
  ```

- `platform_url()` - Get platform access URL
  ```sql
  CALL platform_url();
  ```

**Configuration Management:**
- `get_app_configuration()` - View current configuration
  ```sql
  CALL get_app_configuration();
  ```

- `set_compute_pool(pool_name)` - Set compute pool for platform
  ```sql
  CALL set_compute_pool('prometheux_compute_pool');
  ```

**External Access Management:**
- `add_external_access_integrations(list)` - Add external access integrations
  ```sql
  CALL add_external_access_integrations('integration1,integration2');
  ```

- `remove_external_access_integrations(list)` - Remove external access integrations
  ```sql
  CALL remove_external_access_integrations('integration1');
  ```

**Monitoring & Diagnostics:**
- `check_snapshots()` - Check snapshot status and information
  ```sql
  CALL check_snapshots();
  ```
---

## üìÇ Uploading Data

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Snowflake's shared file system for Native Apps does not support filenames with spaces. Use underscores (`_`) or hyphens (`-`) instead. Example: `my_data_file.csv` not `my data file.csv`.

1. **Via Snowsight UI**: Navigate to `Catalog ‚Üí Database Explorer ‚Üí PROMETHEUX ‚Üí APP_PUBLIC ‚Üí STAGES ‚Üí USER_UPLOADS` and use the upload button.

2. **Via SQL**:
   ```sql
   -- Set up database and schema context for file upload
   USE DATABASE prometheux;
   USE SCHEMA app_public;
   
   -- Upload your file to the user uploads stage
   PUT file://path/to/your.csv @user_uploads AUTO_COMPRESS=FALSE;
   ```

3. The system automatically transfers your file to the internal block volume and makes it available to all back-end components.

## üìÇ Granting Access to Your Existing Databases

To allow Prometheux to access and analyze data in your existing Snowflake databases, you need to grant appropriate privileges to the application. This enables Prometheux to read from and optionally write to your existing data sources.

### üéØ Privilege Overview

Prometheux needs different levels of access depending on your use case:

- **Read-only access**: For data analysis and querying existing data
- **Read-write access**: For data transformation, creating derived tables, and storing analysis results
- **DDL privileges**: For creating temporary tables, views, and functions during complex analyses

### üìã Basic Setup (Read-Only Access)

For basic data analysis and querying:

```sql
-- Set up role context (requires ACCOUNTADMIN or appropriate privileges)
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;  -- Or role with sufficient database privileges

-- Replace YOUR_DATABASE and YOUR_SCHEMA with your actual names
-- Grant basic database and schema access
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE YOUR_DATABASE TO APPLICATION prometheux;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA YOUR_DATABASE.YOUR_SCHEMA TO APPLICATION prometheux;

-- Grant read access to all existing tables
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA YOUR_DATABASE.YOUR_SCHEMA TO APPLICATION prometheux;

-- Grant access to views
GRANT SELECT ON ALL VIEWS IN SCHEMA YOUR_DATABASE.YOUR_SCHEMA TO APPLICATION prometheux;

-- Verify grants
SHOW GRANTS TO APPLICATION prometheux;
```

### üîß Advanced Setup (Read-Write Access)

For data transformation, creating derived tables, and storing analysis results:

```sql
-- Set up role context
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;  -- Or role with sufficient privileges

-- 1. Basic database and schema access
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE YOUR_DATABASE TO APPLICATION prometheux;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA YOUR_DATABASE.YOUR_SCHEMA TO APPLICATION prometheux;

-- 2. Schema-level DDL privileges (for creating tables, views, etc.)
GRANT CREATE TABLE ON SCHEMA YOUR_DATABASE.YOUR_SCHEMA TO APPLICATION prometheux;
GRANT CREATE VIEW ON SCHEMA YOUR_DATABASE.YOUR_SCHEMA TO APPLICATION prometheux;
GRANT CREATE SEQUENCE ON SCHEMA YOUR_DATABASE.YOUR_SCHEMA TO APPLICATION prometheux;
GRANT CREATE FUNCTION ON SCHEMA YOUR_DATABASE.YOUR_SCHEMA TO APPLICATION prometheux;
GRANT CREATE PROCEDURE ON SCHEMA YOUR_DATABASE.YOUR_SCHEMA TO APPLICATION prometheux;

-- 3. Table-level DML privileges
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA YOUR_DATABASE.YOUR_SCHEMA TO APPLICATION prometheux;

-- 4. View privileges
GRANT SELECT ON ALL VIEWS IN SCHEMA YOUR_DATABASE.YOUR_SCHEMA TO APPLICATION prometheux;

-- 5. Sequence privileges (for auto-incrementing columns)
GRANT USAGE ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA YOUR_DATABASE.YOUR_SCHEMA TO APPLICATION prometheux;

-- 6. Function and procedure access
GRANT USAGE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA YOUR_DATABASE.YOUR_SCHEMA TO APPLICATION prometheux;
GRANT USAGE ON ALL PROCEDURES IN SCHEMA YOUR_DATABASE.YOUR_SCHEMA TO APPLICATION prometheux;

-- 7. Verify all grants
SHOW GRANTS TO APPLICATION prometheux;
```

### üéõÔ∏è Granular Access Control

For precise control over what Prometheux can access:

```sql
-- Set up role context
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

-- Grant access to specific tables only
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE YOUR_DATABASE TO APPLICATION prometheux;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA YOUR_DATABASE.YOUR_SCHEMA TO APPLICATION prometheux;

-- Grant access to specific tables
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE YOUR_DATABASE.YOUR_SCHEMA.CUSTOMERS TO APPLICATION prometheux;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE YOUR_DATABASE.YOUR_SCHEMA.ORDERS TO APPLICATION prometheux;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE YOUR_DATABASE.YOUR_SCHEMA.PRODUCTS TO APPLICATION prometheux;

-- Grant write access to specific results tables
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLE YOUR_DATABASE.YOUR_SCHEMA.ANALYSIS_RESULTS TO APPLICATION prometheux;

-- Verify grants
SHOW GRANTS TO APPLICATION prometheux;
```

---

## üîê **External Access Configuration**  

To enable Prometheux to connect to external services (e.g., Prometheux API, Azure OpenAI, internet resources), you must create and configure external access integrations in Snowflake. These integrations define the network rules and permissions for outbound connections.
To enable external access, you need to create the integrations first before adding them to the app.

#### Prometheux API Integration
```sql
-- Set up database and schema context
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;  -- Or your role if granted CREATE INTEGRATION privileges
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS prometheux_integrations;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS prometheux_integrations.security;
USE DATABASE prometheux_integrations;
USE SCHEMA prometheux_integrations.security;

CREATE OR REPLACE NETWORK RULE prometheux_network_rule
  MODE = EGRESS
  TYPE = HOST_PORT
  VALUE_LIST = ('*.prometheux.ai', 'databases.prometheux.ai:0');

CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION prometheux_outbound
  ALLOWED_NETWORK_RULES = (prometheux_network_rule)
  ENABLED = true;

GRANT USAGE ON INTEGRATION prometheux_outbound TO APPLICATION prometheux;
```

#### Azure OpenAI Integration  
```sql
-- Set up database and schema context
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;  -- Or your role if granted CREATE INTEGRATION privileges
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS prometheux_integrations;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS prometheux_integrations.security;
USE DATABASE prometheux_integrations;
USE SCHEMA prometheux_integrations.security;

CREATE OR REPLACE NETWORK RULE azure_openai_network_rule
  MODE = EGRESS
  TYPE = HOST_PORT
  VALUE_LIST = ('*.azure.com', '*.openai.com', '*.openai.azure.com', '*.cognitiveservices.azure.com', 'openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net');

CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION azure_openai_outbound
  ALLOWED_NETWORK_RULES = (azure_openai_network_rule)
  ENABLED = true;

GRANT USAGE ON INTEGRATION azure_openai_outbound TO APPLICATION prometheux;
```

#### General Internet Access
```sql
-- Set up database and schema context
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;  -- Or your role if granted CREATE INTEGRATION privileges
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS prometheux_integrations;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS prometheux_integrations.security;
USE DATABASE prometheux_integrations;
USE SCHEMA prometheux_integrations.security;

CREATE OR REPLACE NETWORK RULE general_internet_rule
  MODE = EGRESS
  TYPE = HOST_PORT
  VALUE_LIST = ('0.0.0.0:80', '0.0.0.0:443');

CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION all_outbound
  ALLOWED_NETWORK_RULES = (general_internet_rule)
  ENABLED = true;

GRANT USAGE ON INTEGRATION all_outbound TO APPLICATION prometheux;
```

#### Share logs and analytics to Prometheux
```sql
-- Set up database and schema context
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;  -- Or your role if granted CREATE INTEGRATION privileges
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS prometheux_integrations;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS prometheux_integrations.security;
USE DATABASE prometheux_integrations;
USE SCHEMA prometheux_integrations.security;

CREATE OR REPLACE NETWORK RULE prometheux_telemetry_network_rule
  MODE = EGRESS
  TYPE = HOST_PORT
  VALUE_LIST = ('eu.i.posthog.com');

CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION prometheux_telemetry_outbound
  ALLOWED_NETWORK_RULES = (prometheux_telemetry_network_rule)
  ENABLED = true;

GRANT USAGE ON INTEGRATION prometheux_telemetry_outbound TO APPLICATION prometheux;
```

---

### üéõÔ∏è Managing External Access Integrations

Once you have created the necessary external access integrations, you can manage them for the Prometheux application using the following procedures:

```sql

USE DATABASE prometheux;
USE SCHEMA v1;

-- Add external access integrations (comma-separated list)
CALL add_external_access_integrations('prometheux_outbound,azure_openai_outbound');

-- Remove external access integrations
CALL remove_external_access_integrations('prometheux_outbound');

-- View current configuration
CALL get_app_configuration();
```

Once the integrations are added, you can restart the platform to apply the changes:

```sql
-- Set up database and schema context for app control
USE DATABASE prometheux;
USE SCHEMA v1;
-- Start with new external access integrations settings
CALL init();
```

---

## üîÑ Modifying compute pool settings

USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

-- Example: Create a new compute pool with different specifications
CREATE COMPUTE POOL high_performance_pool FOR APPLICATION prometheux
    MIN_NODES = 1
    MAX_NODES = 1
    INSTANCE_FAMILY = CPU_X64_L        -- Upgraded from CPU_X64_M
    AUTO_RESUME = TRUE;

-- Grant usage privileges
GRANT USAGE ON COMPUTE POOL high_performance_pool TO APPLICATION prometheux;
```

#### Step 2: Update Configuration
```sql
-- Set up database and schema context
USE DATABASE prometheux;
USE SCHEMA v1; 
-- Update compute pool
CALL set_compute_pool('high_performance_pool');
-- View current configuration
CALL get_app_configuration();
```

#### Step 3: Start with New Configuration
```sql
-- Set up database and schema context for app control
USE DATABASE prometheux;
USE SCHEMA v1;

-- Start with new compute pool
CALL init();
```

## üîß **App Management**

All app management is handled through simple procedures. The platform automatically manages data persistence and configuration.

### **Core Operations**

```sql
-- Set up database and schema context
USE DATABASE prometheux;
USE SCHEMA v1;

-- Initialize/restart platform with stored configuration
CALL init();

-- Get platform URL
CALL platform_url();

-- Stop platform (automatically creates snapshot)
CALL stop_platform();
```

### **Configuration Management**

```sql
-- View current configuration
CALL get_app_configuration();

-- Set compute pool
CALL set_compute_pool('prometheux_compute_pool');

-- Add external access integrations (comma-separated list)
CALL add_external_access_integrations('integration1,integration2,integration3');

-- Remove external access integrations  
CALL remove_external_access_integrations('integration1,integration2');
```

### **Viewing Application Logs**

To view application logs and troubleshoot issues, you can query Snowflake's telemetry events:

```sql
-- View recent application logs (most recent first)
SELECT
    TIMESTAMP                      AS time_utc,
    VALUE::string                  AS message
FROM SNOWFLAKE.TELEMETRY.EVENTS
WHERE RECORD_TYPE = 'LOG'
  AND (
        RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES['snow.application.name'] = 'PROMETHEUX'
        OR RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES['snow.database.name'] = 'PROMETHEUX'
      )
ORDER BY time_utc DESC;
```

> **üí° Tip:** Use this query to monitor application startup, diagnose connectivity issues, or track service behavior. Logs are especially useful when troubleshooting external access integration problems or service initialization delays.
