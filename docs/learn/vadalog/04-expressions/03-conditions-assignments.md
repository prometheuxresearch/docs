# Conditions & Assignments

## Conditions

Rules can be enriched with conditions in order to constrain specific values for
variables of the body. Syntactically, the conditions follow the body of the
rule. A condition is the comparison (`>,<,==,>=,<=,<>`) of a variable (the LHS of
the comparison) of the body and an **expression** (the RHS of the comparison).

Notice that although the comparison symbols used in conditions are partially
overlapped with the symbols for comparison operators they have different semantics. 
While comparison operators calculate Boolean results, comparison symbols in conditions
only specify a filter.

Each rule can have multiple comma-separated conditions.

```prolog showLineNumbers {3}
contract("Mark",14).
contract("Jeff",22).
rich(X) :- contract(X,Y),Y>=20.
@output("rich").
```

In the example we individuate the contracts for `Y>=20` and classify the
respective employee as rich. The expected result is:

```
rich("Jeff").
```

Consider this next example:

```prolog showLineNumbers {3}
balanceItem(1, 7, 2, 5).
balanceItem(2, 2, 2, 7).
error(E, I) :- balanceItem(I, X, Y, Z), X <> Y+Z.
@output("error").
```

Here, we individuate the balance items for which X is different from the sum of
Y and Z and report an error E for the identifier I of such an item. The expected
result is:

```
error(_e, 2).
```

This next example selects the senior English players.

```prolog showLineNumbers {13}
player(1, "Chelsea").
age(1, 24).
player(2, "Bayern").
team("Chelsea").
age(2, 25).
player(2, "Bayern").
team("Chelsea").
age(2, 25).
player(3, "Chelsea").
age(3, 18).
team("Chelsea").
team("Bayern").
seniorEnglish(X) :- player(X, Y), team(Y), age(X, A), Y=="Chelsea", A > 20.
@output("seniorEnglish").
```

They are those who play with Chelsea with age greater than 20. The expected
result is:

```
seniorEnglish(1).
```

## Assignment

Rules can be enriched with assignments in order to generate specific values for
existentially quantified variables of the head. Syntactically, the assignments
follow the body of the rule. An assignment is the equation (`=`) of a variable
(the LHS of the equation) of the body and an expression (the RHS of the
equation).

Each rule can have multiple comma-separated assignments.

```prolog showLineNumbers {3,4}
balanceItem("loans", 23.0).
balanceItem("deposits", 20.0).
operations(Q, Z, A) :- balanceItem(I1,X), balanceItem(I2,Y),
                       I1=="loans", I2=="deposits", 
                       Z=X+Y, 
                       A=(X+Y)/2.
@output("operations").
```

This example generates a fact for operations, summing two balance items, one for
loans and one for deposits. Observe that `I1=="loans"` and `I2=="deposits"` are
conditions to select the `balanceItems` (as I1 and I2 appear in the body),
whereas `Z=X+Y` and `A=(X+Y)/2` are assignments (as Z and A do not appear in the
body).

The expected result is:

```
operations(_q, 43, 21.5).
```
