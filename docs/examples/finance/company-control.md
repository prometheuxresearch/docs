# Company control

Company control is a staple of the analysis of ownership structure; it concerns
decision power, i.e., when a subject can direct the decisions of another company
via the control of the majority of the shares.

### Indirect Ownership

This scenario requires determining who takes decisions in a company network,
that is, who controls the majority of votes for each company.

To determine whether a company X controls a company Y, we consider two rules:

1. X directly owns more than 50% of Y; or,
1. X controls a set of companies that jointly, and possibly together with X
   itself, own more than 50% of Y.

This problem can be modeled via the following set of recursive Vadalog rules.

```prolog showLineNumbers
% input company graph, described as ownerships edges
% the company 1 own 0.9% of shares of 2
own(1, 2, 0.9).
% the company 2 own 1.0% of shares of 3
own(2, 3, 1.0).
own(3, 2, 0.1).
own(3, 4, 0.9).
own(4, 5, 1.0).
own(5, 1, 0.1).
own(1, 6, 0.9).
own(6, 5, 1.0).
own(5, 10, 0.9).
own(10, 20, 1.0).
own(20, 1, 0.5).
own(1, 10, 0.9).
own(19, 5, 1.0).
own(10, 19, 0.5).

% base case: if a company X owns Y with shares Q then there is direct a
% controlled_share relationship from X to Y with share Q
controlled_shares(X,Y,Y,Q) :- own(X,Y,Q), X<>Y.

% recursive case: if a company X controls Y with shares K
% and the company Y owns Z with share Q, then there there is a indirect
% controlled_share relationship from X to Y via Z with share Q
controlled_shares(X,Z,Y,Q) :- control(X,Z,K), own(Y,Z,Q), X<>Z, Z<>Y, X<>Y.

% if X has controlled_shares of Y, via any company Z with shares Q, then the total
% controlled share are computed with a monotonic aggregation msum, that groups
% by X and Z and aggregates the sum of Q
total_controlled_shares(X,Y,S) :- controlled_shares(X,Y,Z,Q), S=msum(Q).

% if the total controlled shares Q of Y by X is greater than 0.5, then X
% control Y with shares Q.
control(X,Y,Q) :- total_controlled_shares(X,Y,Q), Q>0.5.

% if group by the company X and Y over the max value of Q then the maximum
% control is M
controlMax(X,Y,M) :- control(X,Y,Q), M=mmax(Q).

@output("controlMax").
```

After execution, the relation `controlMax` contains the following tuples:

```
% Output of controlMax(X,Y,M)
controlMax(1, 2, 1).
controlMax(1, 3, 1).
controlMax(1, 4, 0.9).
controlMax(1, 5, 2).

### Close Link Detection

This scenario consists in determining whether there exists a (direct or
indirect) link between two companies, based on a high overlap of shares.

Formally, two companies ùëê1 and ùëê2 are close links if X (resp. Y) owns directly
or indirectly, through one or more other companies, 20% or more of the share of
Y (resp. X).

Determining whether two companies are closely-linked is extremely important for
banking supervision since a company cannot act as a guarantor for loans to
another company if they share such a relationship.

This problem can be modeled via the following set of recursive Vadalog rules

```prolog showLineNumbers
% input company graph, described as ownerships edges
% the company A own 0.2% of shares of the comapany B
own("A", "B", 0.2).
% the company B own 0.8% of shares of the comapany A
own("B", "A", 0.8).
own("B", "C", 0.2).
own("C", "D", 0.6).
own("D", "A", 0.9).
own("A", "C", 0.2).

% if there the company X owns a percentage W of shares of Y and we add in a set
% the visited node X and the visited node Y, then there is a closeLinkPaths of X
% over Y with shares W and we bring the list of visited nodes P. We bring in the
% head the list and we will use it in recursive rule
closeLinkPaths(X,Y,W,P) :- own(X,Y,W), P={}|X|Y, X<>Y.

% if there is a closeLinkPath from X to Y with shares W1 with a set of visited
% nodes P1, and the node Z is not in the list of the visited nodes, the node Z is
% added in the set of visited nodes, then there is a closeLinkPaths from X,Z
% with visited nodes P
closeLinkPaths(X,Z,J,P) :- closeLinkPaths(X,Y,W1,P1),
                           own(Y,Z,W2),
                           J = W1\*W2,
                           P = P1|Z,
                           Z !in P1.

% if there is a closeLinkPaths from the company X to the company Y with shares W
% and the set of visited nodes P, then there is a close_link_sum by grouping by
% X and Y with totale share J, by aggregating the sum of W
close_link_sum(X,Y,J) :- closeLinkPaths(X,Y,W,P), J = msum(W).

% if there is a close_link_sum of X over Y with shares W, and the shares is
% greater than 0.2, then the companies X and Y are in close link with shares W
close_link(X,Y,W) :- close_link_sum(X,Y,W), W >= 0.2.
@output("close_link").
```

After execution, the relation `close_link` contains the following tuples:

```
% Output of close_link(X,Y,W)
close_link(A, C, 0.24).
close_link(B, D, 0.216).
close_link(D, C, 0.216).
close_link(B, A, 0.908).
close_link(C, D, 0.6).
close_link(A, B, 0.2).
close_link(B, C, 0.36).
close_link(C, A, 0.54).
close_link(D, A, 0.9).
```
