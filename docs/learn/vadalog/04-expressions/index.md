# Expressions

An **expression** is inductively defined as follows:

1. a constant is an expression
2. a variable is an expression
3. a proper combination of expressions (by means of operators) is an expression

Expressions appear in specific parts of a Vadalog program, namely in **operators**, **conditions** and **assignments**.

## Topics in this Section

This section covers all aspects of working with expressions in Vadalog:

- **[Operators](./01-operators.md)** - Comparison, arithmetic, boolean, logical, and string operators
- **[Negation](./02-negation.md)** - Negating truth values and safe usage patterns
- **[Conditions & Assignments](./03-conditions-assignments.md)** - Constraining values and generating new ones
- **[Recursion](./04-recursion.md)** - Recursive rules and graph traversal
- **[Aggregations](./05-aggregations.md)** - Monotonic aggregations for computing sums, counts, min/max
- **[Collections](./06-collections.md)** - Working with arrays, lists, and sets
- **[Specialized Functions](./07-specialized-functions.md)** - Math, hash, date/time, type casting, and interval functions
- **[AI Functions](./08-ai-functions.md)** - Embeddings and LLM integration

Each topic includes comprehensive examples showing practical usage in Vadalog programs.
