# Recursion

We say that a Vadalog program or ontology is **recursive** if the dependency
graph implied by the rules is cyclical. The simplest form of recursion is that
in which the head of a rule also appears in the body (_self-recursive rules_).

Recursion is particularly powerful as it allows for inference based on
previously inferred results.

In self-recursive rules, in case of bodies with two atoms, we distinguish
between:

1. _left recursion_, where the recursive atom is the left-most;
2. _right recursion_, where the recursive atom is the right-most.

Some examples follow.

```prolog showLineNumbers {6}
edge(1, 2).
edge(2, 3).
edge(1, 4).
edge(4, 5).
path(X, Y) :- edge(X, Y).
path(X, Z) :- path(Y, Z), edge(X, Y).
@output("path").
```

The expected results are:

```
path(1, 3).
path(1, 2).
path(1, 5).
path(2, 3).
path(1, 4).
path(4, 5).
```

The examples above show reachability in graphs with left recursion, in the
extended version of the manual further examples.
