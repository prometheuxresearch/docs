# Remote MCP Server

Connect Claude (Desktop or Web) to Prometheux using the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) — an open standard that enables AI assistants to interact with external tools and data sources.

The remote MCP server (`px-remote-mcp-server`) is a cloud-hosted option that works with both Claude Desktop and Claude Web via OAuth authentication, without needing to install anything locally.

## Why Use Remote MCP?

**Best for:** Claude Web users, multi-user deployments, enterprise environments

**Pros:**
- Works with both Claude Desktop and Claude Web
- OAuth authentication with browser login flow
- Centralized deployment (one server, many users)
- Handles authentication and session management
- No local installation required

**Cons:**
- Requires a deployed server instance
- Suitable for production cloud deployments

**Use this when:**
- You want to use Claude Web (browser-based)
- You want centralized authentication for multiple users
- You're deploying for an organization
- You prefer not to install anything locally

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Claude account** (Desktop or Web) at [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
- **Prometheux credentials** (token, username, organization)
- **Deployed remote MCP server** at `https://api.prometheux.ai/px-remote-mcp-server`

### Setup

1. **Open Claude** (Web in your browser at [claude.ai](https://claude.ai), or Desktop app)

2. **Add the MCP Server:**
   - Click your profile icon → Settings
   - Navigate to "Connectors"
   - Click "Add custom connector"

3. **Configure the connection:**
   - **Name:** `prometheux` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Remote MCP Server URL:** `https://api.prometheux.ai/px-remote-mcp-server`
   - Click "Add"

4. **Connect:**
   - Click "Connect" on the Prometheux connector
   - Claude will redirect you to the Prometheux OAuth login page
   - Enter your credentials:
     - **Username:** Your Prometheux username
     - **Organization:** Your Prometheux organization
     - **API Token:** Your Prometheux authentication token
   - Click "Connect to Claude"

5. **Start using:** The connection is now active. Claude Web will automatically use the Prometheux tools when relevant to your queries.

## Usage

Once connected, interact naturally with Claude (Desktop or Web). The AI will automatically use the Prometheux MCP tools when relevant.

## Session Management

- **Sessions persist** until you explicitly disconnect or the server restarts
- **Re-authentication:** If your session expires, Claude will automatically prompt you to log in again
- **Security:** Your Prometheux token remains valid until you revoke it from your Prometheux dashboard

### Disconnecting

To disconnect the remote MCP server:
1. Go to Claude Web Settings → Connectors
2. Find the Prometheux connector
3. Click "Disconnect"

## Troubleshooting

### "Unable to connect" error

Claude Web can't reach the remote MCP server.

**Solution:**
- Verify the server URL is correct: `https://api.prometheux.ai/px-remote-mcp-server`
- Check if your Prometheux credentials are valid
- Ensure the remote MCP server is running and accessible
- Try refreshing your browser and reconnecting

### OAuth login page doesn't load

The authentication flow isn't starting properly.

**Solution:**
- Check your browser's popup blocker settings
- Try the connection flow in an incognito/private window
- Verify the remote MCP server is running and accessible
- Clear your browser cache and cookies for claude.ai

### "Authentication required" after login

Your session expired or credentials are invalid.

**Solution:**
- Your Prometheux token may have been revoked or expired
- Re-authenticate through Claude Web settings (disconnect and reconnect)
- Contact your Prometheux admin to verify your credentials
- Check that you entered the correct username, organization, and token

### Tools not appearing in Claude

Claude doesn't recognize the Prometheux tools.

**Solution:**
- Ensure you completed the OAuth flow successfully
- Check Claude Web's developer console (F12) for error messages
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting the server
- Verify the connector shows as "Connected" in Settings
- Be more explicit in your query: "Use the prometheux tools to list concepts in project X"

### "Connection timeout" error

The remote MCP server is taking too long to respond.

**Solution:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the Prometheux instance is accessible and running
- Check if you're behind a VPN or firewall that might be blocking access
- Try again in a few moments - the server might be temporarily overloaded
